When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    The main reasons why you would use a remote repository are to backup all 
    the files you are working on and share them publicly or with your team mates.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatic pull of a remote can help you to keep up with what
    your colleagues are doing. However, if you are writing in local
    the same part ofcode as your team mates, you may get unexpected changes, which are confusing or don't work with your code.
